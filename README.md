You saw Apple September 2017 event. You probably heard about of Apple's last innvoation, iPhone X (TEN).

You, the average Android user, probably had a laugh on Apple users about the new camera notch that covers the screen's content.

It is funny, I agree.

Your Apple fanboys probably said it's not that noticeable, and that you haven't tried it yourself.

Well, you won't pay 999$ just to test it. And now, you don't need to!

Introducing ***XOutOf10*** *by Idoideas*, a simulation of iPhone X's notch for any Android device, so you could feel how it's like.

## Download

You can [download the latest APK right here](https://github.com/idoideas/XOutOf10/blob/master/XOutOf10.apk?raw=true), or [download the app directly from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.idoideas.xoutof10).

~~Please notice that the app works on Android 6.0+.~~ **Now supports all Android devices, all the way back to Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0!**

**Android 6.0+ Users**: In your first run, please make sure you "permit drawing over apps".

**Android 8.0 Oreo users:** Please note that the notch will be hidden when you expand your status bar. That occurs due to Android API limitations set by Google.

## How to Enable

1. Download and Install the app..
2. If it's your first time and you're running Android 6.0+ , click on the "Permit Drawing Over Apps" and allow it.
3. Click on "Start".

**Notice!** To stop the simulation, click on "Stop" within the app.
